Important: If you want to run the code on your computer you'll have to modify it a little you'll have to put data in the faces and names list using the functions i made in the code after loading the image.

Description:
Using Opencv and few other libraries I created a model to detect faces and also detect known and unknown faces according to the data provided in the known faces and known names lists. In addition to that you can also see the face landmarks.
